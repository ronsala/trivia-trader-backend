Love trivia? With TriviaTrader, you can play trivia games on many subjects. You can also make your own games to stump your friends and people all over the world.

Let's start by playing a game.

We see several categories of games. Let's pick Arts and Entertainment.

We choose the game we want to play. Let's go with Musical Conspiracy Theories.

Our first question is, "This singer's bare feet on an album cover was interpreted by some as a clue they had died and been replaced by a lookalike". I'll click on "Paul McCartney". And I'm right! If I want to see a source for this answer, there's a link at the bottom that takes us to a BBC article, and we can read more about it.

Clicking Next brings the next question.

"Iconography used by such musicians as Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Kanye West, and Kesha has led to speculation they belong to what organization?"

I'll guess A, and I'm wrong. We see the correct answer is D.

Now that we've seen how basic game play works, let's go through the remaining questions quickly.

[Next, C, Next, B, Next, C]

The game is over, and if I click on Get Score, I see I got three right out of five.

With TriviaTrader, you can not only *play* trivia games, you can also make your *own*, on whatever subjects interest you, to challenge other users.

To do that, we'll go back to the home page by clicking the Home button at the top of the screen.  Then, we'll select "Make game". If you haven't signed up yet [click No], you'll be prompted to do so, which is very easy. Just enter whatever you want for a username, your email, and a password of at least six characters. Retype the password, and you're done. We see at the top of the screen that we're logged in and at the bottom that we haven't created any games yet. Let's do that now. [click Home, "Make game"]

Since much of TriviaTrader is written in the JavaScript programming language, let's call it "JavaScript 101".

We'll select the category Science & Tech and click Next.

Question 1, "Who invented JavaScript?" For potential answers, let put, "Matz", "Guido van Rossum", "Grace Hopper", and "Brendan Eich". And let's select D, since that's the correct answer. To back it up, we'll paste a link to Chapter 4 from the book *Speaking JavaScript*. [http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch04.html]. To keep this video short, I'll enter the remaining questions and come back.... [⇧⌘P]

Now that I've entered all the info for this game, I have a chance to review it question by question and make any changes.

If I go back to my user page, I now see "JavaScript 101" under "Games by this user".
